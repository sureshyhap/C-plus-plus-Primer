/*
  A static class member is a member of a class associated with the class itself as opposed to with an object of the class. Its value is consistent across all objects of the class. It is useful because there may be an attribute of the class that is the same for all objects of the class. They differ from ordinary members by the fact that they can have a relevant value even before any objects of the class are instantiated. Also they need to be defined outside of the class because a constructor can't be used to initialize it.
