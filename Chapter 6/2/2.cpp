/*
  a. The string s only exists for the lifetime of the function so you can't
  return it. Also the return type should be int not string. Can fix by passing in a string& and assigning it a value in the function (effectively "returning" a string).
  b. There should be a return type even at least a void.
  
  void f2(int i) {

  }

  c. You can't have 2 parameters with the same name.

  int calc(int v1, int v2) {

  }

  d. This is ok.
