/*
  A parameter is local to the function and its value is whatever argument was passed in. A local variable is local to the function (only exists during the function call). A static variable exists across function calls and retains its value.

  A parameter is useful if the function needs to work with or use some external value. A local variable is useful to temporarily hold a value. A static variable is useful for say tracking the number of times a function is called.
